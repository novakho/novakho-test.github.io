Excerpts from a speech

The world is a chessboard on which we play the game that never supposed to be fair. 

I hate to say this but it gets to decide what kind of role we start with when we come to this world. 

The world is not fair, but it doesn't make any less worthy of living. 

So go play with what you have, carefully but boldly at the same time, to unleash the unknow possibility of the life, or change the world.
